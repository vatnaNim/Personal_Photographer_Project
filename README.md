A Nuxt.js project created to deepen my understanding of modern frontend frameworks and REST API integration. The application showcases photographer profiles and testimonials, with dynamic data fetched from a backend API. It was developed as a self-learning exercise using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The project runs locally using "npm run dev" for the client and "npx json-server --watch static/data/photographyDb.json --port 3001" for the backend.
